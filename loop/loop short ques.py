#1) print i is long as i is less than 6

# i=1
# while i<6:
#     print(i)
#     i+=1


#   2)  # exit the loop when i is 3

# i=1
# while i<6:
#     print(i)
#     if i==3:
#        
#     i+=1



#3) continue to the next iteration if i is 3

# i=0
# while i<6:
#     i+=1
#     if i==3:
#         continue
#     print(i)



#4) i is no longer less than 6


# i=1
# while i<6:
#     print(i)
#     i+=1
# else:
#     print("i is no longer less thsn 6")




#5) print each fruit in a fruit list:


# fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]
# for x in fruits:
#     print(x)



# 6) even string are iterable in the word "banana".


# for  x in "banana":
#     print(x)


# 7) exit the loop when x is "banana":


# fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]
# for x in fruits:
#     print(x)
#     if x=="banana":
#        break    
# 
# 
# 
# 8) exit the loop when x is "banana" but this time break comes befor the print
  
# fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]
# for x in fruits:
#     if x =="banana":
#         break 
#     print(x)



#   9) do not banana


# fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]
# for x in fruits:
#     if x =="banana":
#         continue
#     print(x)



# 10)  using the range () function 

# for x in range(6):
#     print(x)



# 11) using the start parameter


# for x in range(2,6):
#     print(x)



# 12) increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):


# for x in range (2,30,3):
#     print(x)



# 13) print all number from 0 to 5, and print a meesage when the loop has ended


# for x in range (6):
#     print(x)
# else:
#     print("finalli fished!")



# 14) break the loop when will not be executed what happens with the else block:


# for x in range(6):
#     if x ==3:break
#     print(x)
# else:
#     ("finally finished")




# 15  print each adjective for every fruits:

# adj=["red","big","tasty"]
# fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]
# for x in adj:
#     for y in fruits:
#         print(x,y)
